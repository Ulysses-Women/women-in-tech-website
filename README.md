Hey Ladies,
I created an html page that we can use to make it a bit easier to add information to our website.

I was able to create a REST API with a JSON server, just like we used on the movie project.

After you clone the repository:

You'll need to install the following npm after you pull the project...

Enter this into your terminal:

    npm install -g json-server 

Then just launch the "add-information.html" page and run the following code in your terminal:

    json-server --watch db.json
    
After you submit the form, the changes should be reflected on the db.json file in the root of the project.

We're just using this html page as a tool to build our json. We can create an index page and install any other packages 
we might need seperately.

Thanks!

Ladies,

I am starting to create the index page on my own branch.
