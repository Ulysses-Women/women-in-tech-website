Hey Ladies,
I worked with Ryan yesterday to install some more necessary 
node packages so that our project runs similarly to the movies project.

Once you pull from master, you will see the list of npm libraries that need
to be installed...

  "dependencies": {
    "babel-core": "^6.26.3",
    "babel-loader": "^7.1.4",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1.7.0",
    "concurrently": "^3.5.1",
    "jquery": "^3.3.1",
    "json-server": "^0.13.0",
    "moment": "^2.22.2",
    "npm": "^6.1.0",
    "promise-polyfill": "^8.0.0",
    "webpack": "^4.11.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.0.3",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.1.4",
    "whatwg-fetch": "^2.0.4"
  }
  
first run:  
    
    npm install

Then: 

    npm install packagename 

for each package that needs to be installed.

Once everything is installed just run: 

    npm run dev
    
Then visit http://localhost:1313/

This points to the "index.html" page.

Let me know if you have questions! 

Thanks! 

-Emily
